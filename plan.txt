		Web Scraping
		Datasets
	Data Preparation
		load and inspect raw data
			what to look for
				Duplicate data
				Wrong dtypes (year as string?)
				Outliers
				country name mistmatches
		Standardize Country & Year
			Country Map
				example
					Philippines
						PH
						Republic of the Philippines
			year
				between 2000 -2024
		Handle Missing Values
			variable types
				Time-invariant (e.g. country)
				Smooth Trends (GDP, Population)
				Sparse (modal share, rail_km)
				missing
		Feature Engineering
			New Variable
				log_gdp_per_capita
				log_population
				transit_invest_dummy
				high_invest_dummy
				urbanization_rate
				road_per_capita
		Outliter Detection & Winsorization
			Cap extreme values at 99th percentile
		Panel Balance Check
			How many years per country?
				Keep only countries with >= 10 years
		Train-Test Split (TIme Based)
			Use 2020-2024 as holdout (for simulation)
		Filan Clean Panel Structure

		Validation: Visual Sanity Checks
			1. Time trend
			2. Scatter: Investment vs Congestion

	Full EDA & Causal Pipeline
		Univariate & Missingness
			Plot Distributions
		Time Trends per Country
			What to look for?
				example
					Singapore
						Congestion ↓ after 2010 → MRT Line 4?
					Bogota
						Drop after 2000 → TransMilenio?
					Philippines
						Flat or rising → no major investment?
